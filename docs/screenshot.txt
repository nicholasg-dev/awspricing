This is a placeholder for the screenshot.

In a real project, you would replace this with an actual screenshot of the application.
The screenshot should show the main interface of the AWS EC2 Instance Pricing Tool,
including the data grid with instance pricing and some of the enhanced features like
the price history chart or savings calculator.

To create a screenshot:
1. Run the application in development mode
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Take a screenshot of the application interface
4. Save the screenshot as 'screenshot.png' in this directory
5. Update the README.md file to reference this screenshot
